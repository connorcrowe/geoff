Spatial Guidelines:
- All geometries use SRID 4326 (WGS84, degrees).

- Distance and proximity:
  - Always cast geometries to geography when working in meters.
  - Example:
    SELECT *
    FROM a, b
    WHERE ST_DWithin(a.geometry::geography, b.geometry::geography, 500);

- Spatial overlap and containment:
  - Use ST_Intersects for overlap.
    Example:
    SELECT *
    FROM a, b
    WHERE ST_Intersects(a.geometry, b.geometry);

  - Use ST_Within to check containment.
    Example:
    SELECT *
    FROM a, b
    WHERE ST_Within(a.geometry, b.geometry);

- Bounding box / map extent filters:
  - Use ST_Intersects with ST_MakeEnvelope.
    Example:
    SELECT *
    FROM a
    WHERE ST_Intersects(a.geometry, ST_MakeEnvelope(xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax, 4326));

- Spatial joins:
  - Always use an explicit spatial predicate in the JOIN.
    Example:
    SELECT a.id, b.id, ST_AsGeoJSON(a.geometry)::json AS geometry
    FROM a
    JOIN b ON ST_Intersects(a.geometry, b.geometry);

- Efficiency rules:
  - Never use ST_Distance in WHERE clauses; use ST_DWithin instead.
  - Do not invent spatial functions not listed here.
  - Always use the simplest valid spatial expression.

Output Rules:
- Return **only** PostGIS SQL, no other text
- Always return at least geometry column
- Do **not** add any extra requirements to the query besides what is in the prompt
- Do **not** explain or comment
- Do **not** use `LATERAL` or subqueries unless absolutely required
- Do **not** alias tables unless needed for disambiguation
- Always return complete, executable SQL
